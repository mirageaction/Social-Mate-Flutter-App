## 🏗️ Project Architecture

This project follows **Clean Architecture** principles to ensure a highly scalable, maintainable, and testable codebase. The separation of concerns is strictly maintained across three primary layers:

### 1. 📂 Presentation Layer
*   **Widgets & Pages**: Pure UI components built with Flutter.
*   **BLoC / Cubit**: Handles state management and interacts with Domain usecases.
*   **Routing**: Managed via `go_router` for declarative navigation.

### 2. 🧠 Domain Layer (Pure Dart)
*   **Entities**: Simple Dart classes representing the core data models.
*   **Use Cases**: Contains specific business logic and coordinates data flow.
*   **Repositories (Interfaces)**: Defines contracts for data operations, ensuring the domain layer is independent of external dependencies.

### 3. 💾 Data Layer
*   **Repositories (Implementations)**: Implements the contracts defined in the Domain layer.
*   **Data Sources**: Handles direct communication with local storage or remote APIs (e.g., Supabase).
*   **Models**: DTOs (Data Transfer Objects) that handle JSON serialization/deserialization.

### 🧩 Folder Structure
```text
lib/
├── core/                  # Shared utilities, themes, DI, and routes
├── features/              # Modular features (e.g., auth, home)

├── global/                # App-wide BLoCs and Global State
└── main.dart              # Entry point
```

## 🎨 UI Kit / Design System

The application follows a consistent and modern design language to ensure a premium feel across all screens.

### 🎨 Color Palette

*   **Secondary**: `#0779B8` 🔹 - Used for accents and secondary elements.
*   **Surface**: `#FFFFFF` ⚪ - Clean white background for a minimalist look.
*   **Error**: `#FF1E1E` 🔴 - Clear visibility for error states and destructive actions.

### ✍️ Typography
*   **Body & Headings**: Utilizing the default Material Design typography scale, optimized for readability.
*   **Responsive Scaling**: All text sizes are dynamically scaled using `flutter_screenutil` to ensure consistency across various device densities.

### 🖼️ Iconography
*   **SVG Icons**: Custom managed high-quality SVGs via `flutter_gen` for sharp visuals at any size.
*   **Cupertino Icons**: Standard iOS-style icons for a familiar and native mobile experience.
